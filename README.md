Invoicing is an important step of ALMA Acquisition. The correct invoices help managing Acquisition data and tracking payment history. After the purchasing step, receiving physical items step or activating electronic titles step, the invoicing step jumps on the stage.
There were 3 ways to process invoices, which encompass creating invoices via EDI, creating invoices from PO/manually, and creating invoices from the Excel file. The Excel file format provided by ALMA adopts an interlacing way to store the invoice and invoice line data. By this way, you could put as more invoice lines as you like, with huge advantage. However, before Excel file was uploaded, you have to select the vendor. It probably means you have to organize your invoice Excel files vendor by vendor before importing to ALMA.
Due to the requirements to process hundreds of invoices in batch, a PHP script was written to create the Invoices, then the corresponding invoices lines data by using ALMA API. A new Excel file format was used to achieve the target. Each line in this Excel table contains 3 chunks of data which are the invoice, regular invoice line, and shipment invoice line. In very rare situations, other invoice line types will be used, so only the regular and shipment type were included.
